            <div class="about">
                <p>Dee's Cakes n' Bakes first opened in Birmingham in 2012. Its mission was to provide the UK market 
                    with a new concept; delicious fresh cream Celebration Cakes made without using eggs and an ‘on demand’ service. By eliminating 
                    the egg, without compromising on taste and texture, our cakes were an instant success; and a favourite amongst many who have
                    certain religious, dietary and/or lifestyle choices. The cakes are so light and fluffy and made to a high end recipe that 
                    we still use today.  Our commitment to quality and value means that you will receive a fantastic, delicious product, every 
                    time.</p>  
                    
                    <p>We began to increase in popularity and opened its second franchise a year later and has never looked back. Here at 
                    Dee's, we like to think of each other as family, and our success is due to our commitment to the brand and extending our family 
                    circle to include our customers.  We pride ourselves on using only the finest quality ingredients, and taking the utmost care
                    in the production of our cakes. We now have stores in Birmingham, Leicester, and Manchester.</p> 
                    
                    <p>All our products are 100% egg free.  Many of the founders' family members follow a strict 
                    lacto-vegetarian diet and that is how they came up with the idea for the company. Whilst our cakes are egg free, you really
                    can’t taste the difference, which makes them a perfect choice for any occasion.</p>
